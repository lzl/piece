### The UI

- The UI is the surface of that Core. Visitors see and use Core with the help of UI.
- I try to use React.

### The Core

- Reuse the code from old day. Including collection, methods and publication. Which is the Core 思密达~
- The one and only one collection is the store of pieces.
- The two methods access that store with a security guard.
- The publication defines what you can see.
