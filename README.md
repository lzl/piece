### The UI

- The UI is the interface of that Core. Visitors see and use Core with the help of UI.
- I try to use React. Get started with the official Meteor-React tutorial.
- Component App and Card. Card is the interface of each piece.
- Yes, that Card is from Bootstrap v4.
- There is a textarea to submit your piece.
- In the card, you can delete piece.

### The Core

- Reuse the code from old day. Including collection, methods and publication. Which is the Core 思密达~
- The one and only one collection is the store of pieces.
- The two methods access that store with a security guard.
- The publication defines what you can see.
